Primary function is to control two LEDs, specifically D2 and D3, which are connected to pins 8 and 9 of the GPIOA port.

The SystemClock_Config() function is typically utilized for setting up the system clock of the microcontroller, however, it is empty in this instance and therefore does not configure the clock.

A delay() function has been implemented to introduce a pause in the execution of the program.

Within the main() function, the clock for GPIOA is enabled, allowing for subsequent operations on this port.

The pin configurations for the LEDs are set to output mode within the main() function.

The program enters an infinite loop, toggling the state of the LEDs, resulting in them blinking at a rate of three times per second.

The code does not encompass semihosting hardfault handling or ETM (Embedded Trace Macrocell) tracing features.
