It controls two LEDs (D2 and D3) attached to pins 8 and 9 of the GPIOA port.

In this instance, the SystemClock_Config() function is declared but not implemented. Thus, the microcontroller defaults to using the High-Speed Internal (HSI) RC oscillator at a frequency of 16 MHz as the system clock source.

The delay() function is implemented to introduce a pause in the program execution.
The program includes variables etm_tc_len, etm_tc, etm_tc_idx, and etm_exit for Embedded Trace Macrocell (ETM) tracing. They are placed in a ".non_init" section to prevent them from being initialized during system start-up.

In the main() function, the system clock is configured by calling SystemClock_Config().
A breakpoint is inserted before the LED initialization process for debugging purposes.
The GPIOA clock is enabled, and the pin configurations for the LEDs are set to output mode within the main() function.

The LEDs are initially set to off (assuming they are active high).

Another breakpoint is inserted before the LED blinking loop begins.

The program enters an infinite loop, toggling the state of the LEDs, causing them to blink three times per second. Breakpoints are inserted before and after each LED toggle for debugging.

Finally, a breakpoint is inserted after the LED blinking loop.

Incorporates ETM tracing and semihosting, allowing  debugging and monitoring of the program execution.
