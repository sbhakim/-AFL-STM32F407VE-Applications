UART polling is a method of data transmission where the microcontroller continually checks the STATUS register of the UART interface to determine whether data is ready to be read or written. Instead of relying on interrupts, the microcontroller actively "polls" the UART peripheral's status. 




The code sends the data in etm_tc array through UART using the HAL_UART_Transmit() function.The code includes breakpoints before and after data transmission for debugging purposes.


Two global variables, etm_tc_len and etm_tc, are declared for Embedded Trace Macrocell (ETM) tracing. They are stored in a ".non_init" section to prevent initialization during startup.
Within the main() function, the system clock is configured and the GPIOA clock, as well as the USART2 clock, are enabled.

The GPIO pins PA2 and PA3 are initialized and configured for UART functionality. They are set up as alternate function push-pull mode with a pull-up resistor and very high speed.

The USART2 peripheral is initialized and configured with specific parameters including a baud rate of 115200, a word length of 8 bits, 1 stop bit, no parity, no hardware flow control, and both transmission and reception modes enabled.

The UART initialization is checked for errors, with an infinite loop entered in the case of an error.
A breakpoint is inserted before sending data through UART for debugging purposes.

Data is then transmitted through UART using the HAL_UART_Transmit() function, which sends the etm_tc array of length etm_tc_len with a timeout value of 5000.

If a transfer error occurs during the transmission process, an infinite loop is entered.
A breakpoint is inserted after the data transmission for debugging purposes.

A loop for echoing received characters back is commented out but can be uncommented to enable this functionality.
